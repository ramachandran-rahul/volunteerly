# Volunteerly

**Volunteerly** is a Swift-based iOS application designed to help users discover and participate in volunteering opportunities based on their personal preferences. It offers a seamless way for users to explore volunteering events, manage their profiles, track booked events, and customize their preferences. The app leverages **Firebase** for user authentication and event data storage.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Login**: Users can log in using their email and password.
- **Create Account**: New users can register with their name, email, and password.
- **Reset Password**: Users can request a password reset link via email.

### 2. User Profile Management

  - Environmental

  **Technical Note**: Preferences are stored in Firebase Firestore. When users update preferences, the app fetches new events based on those preferences.

### 3. Event Discovery
- **Opportunities View**: Browse volunteering events based on selected preferences.
- **Search Bar**: Filter events in real-time by typing keywords like title or organization.
- **Event Details**: Each event displays:
  - Title
  - Organization

  - Start and End Dates
  - Location (shown on a map)
  - Category
  - Contact Email

  **Technical Note**: Events are fetched from Firebase Firestore using queries based on user preferences and filtered by upcoming dates.

### 4. Event Registration
- **Sign Up for Events**: Users can register for any available event.
- **Back Out of Events**: If needed, users can back out of registered events before they start.
- **Booked Events**: Users' booked events are displayed on their profile.

  **Technical Note**: Registered events are tracked via Firebase Firestore, where each event's ID is added to the `bookedEvents` array in the user's document.

### 5. Event Sharing
- **Share Events**: Share event details with others via iOS Share Sheet (ShareSheet), including the event title, organization, and dates.

### 6. Map Integration
- **Event Location**: Each event's location is displayed on a map using coordinates from Firebase Firestore.

## Technical Aspects

### 1. Firebase Integration
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user login, registration, and password management.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Stores event data, user preferences, and registered events:
  - **Users Collection**: Stores each user's preferences and booked events.
  - **Events Collection**: Stores event details such as title, organization, category, start/end dates, and location.

### 2. Data Flow
- **Fetching Events**: Events are fetched from Firestore based on user preferences and upcoming dates.
- **Updating Preferences**: Updates are saved in Firestore, triggering new event queries to match preferences.
- **Event Registration**: When users register or back out, event IDs are added or removed from `bookedEvents` in Firestore.

### 3. Search Functionality
The search bar filters events locally based on keywords without making new calls to Firestore.

### 4. ShareSheet Integration
The app uses `UIActivityViewController` for sharing event details via email, messages, or social media.

### 5. Custom UI Components
- **CategoryPillView**: Displays event categories (e.g., Environmental, Social Impact) as tags.
- **CustomTextFieldModifier**: Enhances text fields with icons and styling for input fields (e.g., email, password).

### 6. Map Integration
Uses **MapKit** to display event locations on a map, with data retrieved from Firebase Firestoreâ€™s `GeoPoint` format.
